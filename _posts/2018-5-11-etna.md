title: Giro 2018, stage 6: Post Etna Analysis
---

Thursday's ascent up Monte Etna provided the first summit finish for the contenders to show themselves, and it featured some pretty exciting racing. Simon Yates took the Maglia Rosa while finishing side-by-side with teammate and talented climber Estaban Chavez, who had started the climb as part of the day's early breakaway. Yates was the only contender to sneak out of the group of favorites, putting in a searing attack in the last few kilometers to take 26 seconds over the next group, containing the likes of Thibaut Pinot, Tom Dumoulin and Chris Froome. Rohan Dennis, who had previously been in the Maglia Rosa, did his best to limit the damage, before eventually conceding over a minute on the stage.

With Etna done and dusted, a viable [Strava segment](https://www.strava.com/segments/17622140) for the climb finally surfaced, and we can provide an analysis given that many riders from yesterday's stage have uploaded their results, highlight by Pinot who took the KOM with a time of 34:51. Results across all attempts with a power meter and a rider self inputting a mass are shown in the figure blow.

The fit to the data is remarkably good, and so now the fun begins. We know that the group of favorites started the segment at more or less the same time, though differences in placement at the beginning and end of the segment can lead to modulations of a few seconds, in regards to Strava segment times. The equation obtained for estimating power-to-mass from time on the climb from fitting to the data, is given by:

*\<power\>/mass* = (14888 W/kg\*s)/(*time in seconds*) + (1.05431 W/kg)

Combining this equation Strava times and the official results on the stage, we can infer the following results:

| Place 	| Name               	| Official time 	| Actual Etna time 	| Inferred Etna time 	| Actual power (W) 	| Estimated <power>/mass (W/kg) 	| mass (kg) 	| Estimated <power> (W) 	|
