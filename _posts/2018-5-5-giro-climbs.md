title: The summit finishes of the Giro
---

As noted in yesterday's entry, this year's Giro d'Italia offers no less than 7 stages ending with significant climbs, whether it be the classics of Etna and Zoncolan, or relatively unknown climbs such as Jafferau or Montevergina. Nevertheless, the penultimate climb on these stages offer a great opportunity to study the performance of the overall contenders. While of course we'll have to wait until after the riders finish a stage to analyze their results, today I'll introduce the stages with finishing climbs and show how power-to-mass can be used to predict climbing time.

## Stage 6: Etna
#### Length: 11.9 miles, 7% average gradient, 4,114 ft elevation gain
