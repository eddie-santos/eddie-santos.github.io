title: The summit finishes of the Giro
---

As noted in my last entry, this year's Giro d'Italia offers no less than 7 stages ending with significant climbs, whether it be the classics of Etna and Zoncolan, or relatively unknown climbs such as Jafferau or Montevergine. Nevertheless, the penultimate climb on these stages offer a great opportunity to study the performance of the overall contenders. While of course we'll have to wait until after the riders finish a stage to analyze their results, today I'll introduce the stages with finishing climbs and show how power-to-mass can be used to predict climbing time.

After each of the following stages end, I'll write an entry analyzing the performances of riders based on their times and the curves shown below.

### Stage 6: Etna
#### [Strava segment](https://www.strava.com/segments/17456582): 19.2 km, 7% average gradient, 1,254 m elevation gain


The Giro this years ascends Etna from the South, instead of the more popular route from the East, thus making it difficult to provide much of an analysis since currently there are only 7 riders who have completed this segment! Still, the climb looks intimidating, as it's a roughly 12 mile slog up an average gradient of 7%. My guess is that this will slightly favor the climbers, particularly the ramp of 14% at roughly 5km to go, which we might see a few attacks. The climb gets ever so slightly at the top, so expect a group finish if there's not much fireworks on the lower-to-mid slops.

### Stage 8: Montevergine
#### [Strava segment](https://www.strava.com/segments/8296241): 14.8 km, 5% average gradient, 762 m elevation gain

At an average and fairly consistent gradient of 5%, except the Montevergine to end in a bunch finish. A few contenders may slip due to tired legs, but the easier gradient allows for aerodynamics to come more into play, making it easier for the bigger guys to stay in contention.
