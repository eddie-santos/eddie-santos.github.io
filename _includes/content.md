I'm currently a Software Engineer specializing in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at Google, with previous stops at Airbnb and Salesforce in similar capacities. I always enjoy leveraging machine learning on novel datasets to build fun new products. Previously, I was a theoretical particle physicist, where my research studied the impact of the mass of the lightest Higgs boson in the two-Higgs Doublet Model on the evolution of the universe.

I'm also huge fan of cycling having raced during my graduate school years, though now I mainly ride for pleasure as well as follow professional cycling from afar! Check out my blog where I keep a running commentary on analyzing the performances of professional riders using machine learning.
